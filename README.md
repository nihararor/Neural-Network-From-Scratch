# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

# YouTube Trending Video Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a YouTube video will trend based on its features like view count, comment count, and category ID. It uses a simple neural network implemented in Python with NumPy and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project (India_Youtube.csv) contains information about YouTube videos in India, including features like view count, likes, dislikes, comment count, and category ID.
# Note:- Here i use Demo-Data.xlsm because my main data is too big that it is not able to load on git. 
# Results
The neural network achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set.
